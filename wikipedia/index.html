            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>David Kim lives in San Jose, California with his daughter Margot. His wife Pamela was diagnosed with
                lymphoma and died before Margot entered high school. One night Margot attempts to call David three
                times, but he is asleep. The next morning David cannot get in contact with Margot. Believing she has
                gone to her piano lesson after school, David calls the piano instructor, but he is informed that Margot
                cancelled her lessons six months prior. He discovers that she was pocketing the money and transferred it
                to a now-deleted Venmo account. He calls the police and the case is assigned to Detective Rosemary Vick.
                Accessing Margot's accounts, David learns that she had become a loner since Pamela's death. Vick reports
                that Margot made a fake ID and shows traffic camera footage of her car outside of the city, suggesting
                she may have run away. </p>
