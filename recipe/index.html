    <h1>Banana bread</h1>
    <p>With overripe bananas, applesauce, and vanilla extract, this classic banana bread is soft, flavorful, and
        incredibly moist. I tested this recipe a dozen times to make the best banana bread with amazing banana flavor
        and only a little fat. Whether you’re a seasoned baker or a newbie, this is perfect for any occasion, such as
        breakfast, back-to-school snacks, or even as a sweet gift.</p>

            and bake.</li>

        <li><b>Dairy-Free:</b> I used coconut oil instead of butter to keep it allergy-friendly.</li>
    </ul>
